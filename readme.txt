This project demonstrates a machine learning model for detecting fake news articles.
 The model is trained using separate datasets for real and fake news, and it uses a PassiveAggressiveClassifier along with TF-IDF vectorization to classify news as either "fake" or "true."
Features
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model using real and fake news datasets.
Text Classification: Classifies news articles entered by the user as either "fake" or "true."
Interactive User Input: Allows users to input a news article directly and get an immediate classification result.
Model Persistence: Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use.
